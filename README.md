# TRAINING TIMER
## Progressive React Web App
Simple application, which provides training timer,
with the same length of the Training phase and Pause phase.

Application state is divided into rounds.
Each round has Training part and Pause part. By the start button
you can start to measure your training time. If you stop the training phase,
pause phase starts and it has same length as previous training measure.
When pause phase ends, new measure of the training phase starts, etc.
And this loop is repeating until global time expires.
